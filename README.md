# Exploring Web Worker with React

![Overal Flow](https://i.imgur.com/OCrhrCn.jpg)

This is built based on the example given in https://github.com/bharathnayak03/react-webworker-hook but with additional parts where I go through several rounds of trials of errors to explore web workers.

I have also tried to spawn few more sub-workers from the main worker itself.

Working on web worker script is a bit tricky at the beginning, considering that there's a list of limited functions and classes that are available to be used. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers

More information are available in code's comments.
